## Context and Problem Statement

We want to implement our search feature in a way that will make it easiest for the user to navigate.

## Considered Options

* Search bar in the navigation bar
* Separate page for searching

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1 

## Reasons for Choosing Option 1 

* Placing the search bar in the navigation bar makes it fast for the user to search for a recipe because they can click on it and start typing.
* Having the search bar in the navigation bar allows us to search on multiple pages, such as the home page or the user's recipes.

## Pros and Cons of Option 1 

**Pros:** Fastest way to search for a recipe. Can search across multiple pages.

**Cons:** May take up space on the navigation bar.

## Pros and Cons of Option 2

**Pros:** Searching is dedicated to its own page.

**Cons:** Less convenient for user because they have to navigate to another page. May be difficult to distinguish between recipes that the user has created and other recipes.
