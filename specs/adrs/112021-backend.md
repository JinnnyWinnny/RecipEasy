## Context and Problem Statement
For our project, we need to use a backend in order for our website to be functional. 


## Considered Options

* Should we use MongoDB?
* Should we use Firebase?

## Decision Outcome

The decision that we ultimately made was to use Firebase rather than using MongoDB for a few reason. All team members lacked backend experience which made it difficult to begin with when one attempted to do it while Firebase on the other hand is a lot friendlier for beginners. Additionally, Firebase offers a wide variety of features which include hosting a website and user authentication which can reduce the number of software/applications that we use (e.g., avoid heroku). 

## Reasons for Choosing Options
* Friendlier for users who lack backend experience
* More popular which allows for easier assistance when stuck via the Google search or YouTube
* Reduces the number of softwares that will be needed.
